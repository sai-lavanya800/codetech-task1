Purpose: The purpose of this Java program is to act as a basic calculator that allows users to perform arithmetic operations on two numbers. It provides a simple interface where users can input numbers and choose the operation they want to perform (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).

Components: User Input Handling:

Uses Scanner class to take input from the user. It prompts the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation. Arithmetic Operations:

Implements addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input. Uses a switch statement to determine which operation to perform based on the user's choice. Error Handling:

Checks for division by zero before performing division operation to prevent runtime exceptions. Output:

Displays the result of the arithmetic operation to the user. Input Validation:

Ensures that the user input for operation choice is valid (between 1 and 4). Detailed Breakdown: Initialization:

Initializes a Scanner object to read input from the user. Input:

Prompts the user to enter two numbers (num1 and num2) which are of type double. Prompts the user to choose an operation by displaying options (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and reads the user's choice (choice). Operation Execution:

Uses a switch statement to execute the corresponding arithmetic operation based on choice: Addition (+): Adds num1 and num2. Subtraction (-): Subtracts num2 from num1. Multiplication (*): Multiplies num1 and num2. Division (/): Divides num1 by num2. Checks for division by zero and handles accordingly.
